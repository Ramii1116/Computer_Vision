# 🚗 **Automated Number Plate Detection (ANPD)**

## 📌 **Project Overview**

The **Automated Number Plate Detection (ANPD)** project utilizes Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology combined with **OpenCV** and **EasyOCR** to automatically detect and extract vehicle number plates from images. This system can be used in applications such as **traffic surveillance**, **toll management**, and **vehicle tracking**. It efficiently detects and highlights the number plate area, returning the detected text for further processing.

## ✨ **Features**

- **Accurate Number Plate Detection**: Detects vehicle number plates from images.
- **Text Extraction**: Uses **EasyOCR** to extract the number plate text.
- **Real-time Visualization**: The detected number plate is highlighted with bounding boxes and annotated text on the image.
- **Easy to Integrate**: Easily adaptable for various real-time use cases like toll collection, traffic monitoring, etc.

## ⚙️ **Technology Stack**

- **EasyOCR**: A deep learning-based OCR library to extract text from images.
- **OpenCV**: A powerful library for computer vision tasks, used here for image processing and manipulation.
- **NumPy**: Used for efficient array operations.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing the output images with bounding boxes.

## 📥 **Installation & Setup**

### **Prerequisites**
Ensure you have **Python 3.x** and **pip** installed on your system. You can check the versions by running:

bash
- python --version
- pip --version
- Installing Dependencies
- Install the required dependencies using the following command:

bash
- pip install easyocr opencv-python numpy matplotlib
- 🛠️ How To Use
- Clone the Repository:
- Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
- git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ANPD.git
- Input Image:
- Place the input image containing vehicle number plates in the same directory as the script or specify its path.

Run the Script:
Run the script using the following command:

bash
- python detect_number_plate.py
Output:
- The system will output the detected number plate text in the console and show the image with the detected plate highlighted.
